### Working with lyric files
- 📂Open song and lyrics separately or together (`Middle Click`, `Ctrl+O`)

- Paste a song Genius page into the **Main** field to extract clean lyrics
- Toggle **Typing mode** (`` ` ``) to edit lyrics and metadata (⚙️📝**Default metadata tags**)
	- `[ti: ]` prioritizes existing value, song filename, `.lrc` filename, then Genius
	- `[ti: ]`, `[al: ]`, and `[ar: ]` are extracted from Genius pasted lyrics
	- Imported `.lrc` files keep metadata and fallback to default fields
- Opening another song or `.lrc` file overwrites the existing one (pasting appends)
- Reloading or closing the tab resets song and lyrics from browser `sessionStorage`
### Playback controls

- Play/pause with `Space` in **Hotkey mode** or `Ctrl+Space` in any mode
- Adjust playback speed with `Ctrl+1`/`Ctrl+2` and reset speed to 1 with `Ctrl+3` 
	- Each adjustment multiplies the current speed by the⚙️📝**Speed ratio**

### Syncing and reviewing lyrics

- Navigate with `Q`/`E` in **Hotkey mode** or `ArrowUp`/`ArrowDown` keys in any mode
- Adjust timestamps of selected line(s) in **Offset time** mode

	- Select multiple lines with `Ctrl/Shift+Click` or `Shift+↑/↓`
- Review timestamps with `R`/`Shift+R` and **Seek offset** (-600ms default)
	- In **Offset seek** toggle mode (``Shift+` ``), Controls adjust **Seek offset** instead of timestamps
	- **Sync file** (``Ctrl+I ``) adjusts all timestamps by the current **Seek offset**
- Automatically replay lines to review-in-place with ⚙️**Instant Replay** triggers
	- Checking these options prevent `Q`/`E` from repeating while held
		- ⚙️✅"Moving to previous line" (`Q` | `↑` to navigate only)

	- ⚙️✅"Adjusting timestamp" (`A`,`S`,`D`,`F`,`Z`,`X`,`C`,`V`)
- Reduce the ⚙️📝**Undo window** (default 150 ms) if too many edits are undone in one step
### Adding translations
- **Add**/**Hide**/**Merge** fields (`Ctrl+4`, `Ctrl+5`, `Ctrl+6`)
	- Paste Genius lyrics into a **Secondary** field to extract clean lyrics
	- `Middle click` a secondary field or click its 📂 button to open a `.lrc` file
	- Secondary ✅"( )" wraps translations with parentheses to indicate "not main lyrics"
- Merged lyrics are offset 0.01 seconds from the next main field timestamp
- This prevents music players like Feishin from highlighting them to reduce clutter
- **Merge fields** if:
	- Main lyrics have timestamps, including final trailing timestamp
	- Main and secondary fields have the same number of lyric lines
- Mark individual lines as translations with `Ctrl+ArrowLeft`
	- Main ✅"( )" automatically wraps these with parentheses
	- Main ✅"↩"
		- Moves existing inline translations that are in parentheses to new lines
		- Marks them as translations. 
	- Lyrics added while ↩ is checked will be batch converted.
